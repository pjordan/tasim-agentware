This is	version 0.9-SNAPSHOT beta of the TAC AA AgentWare for Java.

The purpose of this release is to provide a basic set of tools for
developing TAC AA agents.  This release contains:

- preliminary APIs for TAC AA agents
- basic setup for communicating with the TAC AA server

More information about TAC AA agent development is available at
http://aa.tradingagents.org

You will need Java SDK 1.5.0 or newer (you can find it at
http://java.sun.com) to be able to develop and run this AgentWare.


Getting the AgentWare to run.
------------------------------


Running
-------
Register your agent at http://localhost:8080/ and then enter
your agent name and password in the configuration file 'aw.conf'.

Then type "java -classpath $CLASSPATH edu.umich.eecs.tac.aa.agentware".

The CLASSPATH environment variable must contain all of the jars in the "lib" directory.

Simple game results can be found at http://localhost:8080/
For information about other TAC AA servers please see
http://aa.tradingagents.org


Configuring the AgentWare
-------------------------
The AgentWare reads the configuration file 'config/aw.conf' at startup. This
file allows, among other things, the configuration of agent
implementations. See the file 'aw.conf' for more information.

Note: by default the AgentWare will automatically create and join a
new game after a game has ended. You can specify how many games it
automatically should create and join by setting the 'autojoin' option
in the configuration file 'aw.conf'.
